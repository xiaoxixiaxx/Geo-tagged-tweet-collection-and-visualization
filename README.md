The map uses QGIS to visualize the geographic location (longitude and latitude) of the information sent by Twitter users in the United States at 23:44 PM on January 27.
The data is captured by running a python script. To retrieve geotagged tweets, three bounding boxes are defined, namely "Washington State, New York, and California". The filter parameter is "Geography, GIS, Data Science" and the time limit is set to 60.
These data are mainly concentrated on the East Coast and West Coast. Mainly distributed in New York and California. Florida's data also looks dense.
